# 🚗 Feels on Wheels

Inspired by the popular [Drive and Listen website](https://driveandlisten.herokuapp.com/)

Originally forked from this [repo](https://github.com/Nd98/DriveAndListen)


  - **Context + Inspiration:** One fine night while having a chat with my close friend, we were on the topic of how lofi music become more "popular" as a result of cooping up at home when he shared with me the Drive and Listen website. This is right up my alley! I really love and miss traveling and thus this project was started as sort of a travel diary for me.

  - It contains the cities I have been to and places I would like to visit once COVID decided to end its world  tour

  - _Takeaways: Gifs are more convenient than CSS and SVG as the latter will take numerous lines of code to implement. Autoplay function didn't work out due to browser blocking policy, I need to implement an event to detect and handle autoplay failure._

  - **_Technologies used:_** React
